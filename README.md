# one-line
#### hilarious joke gone horribly wrong
---
helo im quak. i figured out how to write awful and illegible one-liners in python without statements over the course of about a year. i'm writing this primarily for friends in high school computer science classes so if someone else happens to come across this sorry if i seem a bit pedantic or something

to structure this i'm going to go through a bunch of exercises i've found online and write them both ways, while also explaining what i'm doing in what is hopefully too much detail
