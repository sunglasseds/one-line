to structure this i'm going to go through a bunch of exercises i've found online and write them both ways, while also explaining what i'm doing in what is hopefully too much detail

## intro
<p align="center"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Guido_van_Rossum_OSCON_2006.jpg/220px-Guido_van_Rossum_OSCON_2006.jpg" alt="guido"></p>

the soft bearded beer-toting bear pictured above is named "Guido van Rossum." he wrote the first version of python in about a month's worth of free time and is known as python's benevolent dictator for life. he has various [negative opinions](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196) on the inclusion of the techniques i am about to show you in python, which are usually referred to as "functional programming." this is essentially going to be a very convoluted and disgusting guide to functional programming as well as evidence that it should not be as prevalent in python as it is now

i desperately hope that this never happens; i love that python gives me the freedom to write awful code like this
